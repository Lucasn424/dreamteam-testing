        To find new ways to make students feel safe and at home when they arrive
        at Imperial admist the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-lg">Impact</h3>
      <p class="text-justify text-sm">
        Given that masks are a necessity in public spaces we created a face
        covering that not only provides exceptional protection to students but
        also makes them feel part of the wider Imperial community. We designed 4
        unique designs that represent the values and experiences of Imperial
        students, and our HeiQ Viroblock equipped masks provided a seriously
        high level of protection. In support, we designed a marketing campaign,
        created posters, and directed and filmed a promotional video for
        students. Currently, we have sold over 1000 masks with a reorder
        approved.
